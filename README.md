# Audio_Work

An audio program with a web based UI.
Functionality to:
- Create and open audio files of .wav type.
- Can prepend, append, or insert audio data into audio files. 
- Can tailor audio data sample via UI to achieve desired frequencies, sampling rates, and durations.
- Can save files or optionally convert to .mp3 type prior to saving.

Use case is making purely digitized music for use in video games, youtube videos, or anytime deseriable.
Could allow for mapping musical notes with duration into actual audio files. 
Major stretch goal would be for the program to ingest music notation, interpret notes and duration, and produce audio file.

requirements.txt:
A simple text file listing package names and versions.
Use pip install -r requirements.txt to recreate the environment.

Dev env:
# Best practice, use an environment rather than install in the base env
conda create -n my-env
conda activate my-env
# If you want to install from conda-forge
conda config --env --add channels conda-forge
# The actual install command
conda install numpy

Audio Data: The writeframes method in the create_wav_file function expects a bytes object containing the audio data. You'll need to generate this data, typically using a library like NumPy or by reading from another audio source.
Error Handling: Consider adding error handling mechanisms to your code to catch potential exceptions like wave.Error or IOError.
Advanced Features: For more complex audio operations, you might want to explore libraries like scipy or pydub, which offer additional functionalities like audio editing, effects, and analysis.
By understanding these basic operations and leveraging the wave module, you can create, manipulate, and analyze WAV files in your Python applications.

Conversations with music industry folks show there is need for an open-source, mobile friendly, digital audio workstation (DAW) Think apple garbageband, but then enable link to notation format.

Explanation:
app directory:

static: Contains static assets like CSS and JavaScript for the web UI.
templates: Stores HTML templates for the web pages.
views.py: Defines the view functions that handle incoming requests, process data, and render templates.
forms.py: Defines forms for user input, such as file uploads, frequency settings, etc.
audio_processing directory:

audio_file.py: Defines a class to represent audio files, handling operations like reading, writing, and basic manipulations.
audio_operations.py: Implements functions for audio processing tasks like prepending, appending, inserting, and converting formats.
utils.py: Contains utility functions for common tasks, such as file I/O, error handling, or numerical calculations.
requirements.txt: Lists the required Python packages, including libraries for web development, audio processing, and machine learning (if applicable).

Dockerfile: Defines the Docker image configuration for building and deploying the application.

Key Considerations:
Web Framework: Choose a suitable web framework like Flask or Django to handle the web application part. Flask is a good choice for smaller projects, while Django is more suitable for larger, complex applications.
Audio Processing Library: Consider using libraries like pydub or librosa for audio manipulation. These libraries provide a high-level interface for working with audio files.
Machine Learning Integration: If you plan to incorporate machine learning techniques, libraries like scikit-learn or TensorFlow can be useful.
Database: A database like PostgreSQL or SQLite can be used to store user information, project settings, and audio file metadata.
User Interface: Design a user-friendly web interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Consider using a frontend framework like React or Vue.js for more complex UIs.
By following this structure and leveraging the appropriate libraries, you can build a robust and efficient audio processing application.
